            <p>
                Every Internet user sooner or later faces the problem: where to store
                bookmarks - links to frequently visited web resources? Bookmarks provided by browsers can partly solve
                this problem.
                But this functionality is limited and using browser bookmarks is inconvenient.
                Our site Bookmark Manager allows you to solve this problem once and for all.

                At the top of the site there is a toolbar containing buttons with the titles of the pages you are

                and the page title, for example "My services" and click "Submit". The path
                is used in the URL as a unique address for the page on our site. The title will be shown on the toolbar
                button representing the page.

                To create a new page, edit or delete a page, right-click on the page button and use the context menu. To
                swap pages, drag the button with the mouse and

                this button to create the first row. In the form that appears, type an optional row title.

                typing
                the address manually, go to the page you are interested in in the browser, copy the address
                from the address bar, and then return back to the form and paste the address into the "Url" field. In
                the "Label" field,
