                Every Internet user sooner or later faces the problem: where to store
                links to frequently visited web resources? Bookmarks provided by browsers can partly solve this problem.
                But this functionality is limited and using bookmarks is inconvenient.
                Our Weblinks site allows you to solve this problem once and for all.

            <p>
                At the top of the site there is a toolbar containing buttons with the titles of the pages you are
                creating.
                Clicking on a button will open the corresponding page.

                When no pages have been created yet, the toolbar will have an "Add page" button. Click this button to
                create your first page. In the form that appears, type in the path to the page and the page title and
                click "Submit". The path
                is used in the URL as a unique address for the page on our site. The title will be shown on the toolbar
                button
                representing the page.

                To create a new page, edit or delete a page, right-click on the page button and use the context menu. To
                swap pages, drag the button with the mouse and
                drop it.

            </h3>
            <p>
                A page contains rows that are used to place columns.

                this button to create the first row. In the form that appears, type an optional row title.
                To create a new row, edit or delete a row, right-click on the row and use the context menu. To swap
                rows, drag the row with the mouse and drop.

                Columns
            </h3>
            <p>
                The row contains columns that are used to place links.

            <h3>
                Links
            </h3>
            <p>
                The column contains your links to web resources. When you click on a link, the corresponding

                page opens in a new browser tab.

                If the column does not yet contain links, it will show the "Add link" button. Click on

                this button to create the first link. In the form that appears, in the "Url" field, type
                the Internet address of the page starting with the protocol, for example, https://google.com. To avoid
                typing
                the address manually, go to the page you are interested in in the browser, copy the address
                from the address bar, and then return back to the form and paste the address into the "Url" field. In
                the "Label" field,
                type a string that will represent the link in the column.

                To create a new, change or delete a link, right-click on the link and use the context menu. To swap
                links, drag the link with the mouse and
                drop it.
